## 🧑‍💻 Contribute

1. Clone and open this repo in VS Code.  
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.  
3. Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.  
4. Open **Code > Preferences > Color Theme [⌘K ⌘T]** and pick the “GitHub ...” theme you want to test.  
> Note: It seems this has to be done twice because the first time it switches back to the default light theme (possibly a bug).  
5. Make changes to the `/src/theme.js` file.  
6. **UI changes:**  
- For all outer UI elements (status bar, file navigation, etc.), check the [Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color).  
7. **Syntax changes:**  
- For code highlighting tweaks, inspect syntax scopes by invoking the command:  
  ```
  Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes
  ```
  from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) in the Extension Development Host window.  
8. Run `yarn build` to update the theme.  
- Or run `yarn start` to automatically rebuild while making changes (no reload necessary).  
9. Once you're happy, commit your changes and open a Pull Request.
